      <div>
        I started my tech career in Quality Assurance and even taught at the bootcamp I graduated from for a while. My
        next role as an Application Specialist turned into a Software Release Management position a year later.<br />
        <br />
        After 5 years in the industry I still have this urge to become a developer. I recently earned my Full Stack
        Engineering certification. At this point in my career I am hungry and eager to continue learning. I bring a
        diverse range of skills, easy-going personality, and a great sense of humor to every team and endeavor I join.<br />
        <br />
        I believe my past experience in business ownership and hands-on labor has helped immensely in my transition into
        the tech industry.<br />
        <br />
        I learned about:
        <ul>
          <li>hard work</li>
          <li>time management</li>
          <li>teamwork</li>
          <li>keeping a healthy balance in my personal life</li>
          <li>management and leadership</li>
          <li>working with clients first hand and how to interact with them</li>
          <li>finance and budgeting</li>
          <li>and so much more!</li>
        </ul>
        On the weekends I stay active, whether itâ€™s pickleball, fly tying and fishing, golf, or spending time with family,
        friends and pets.

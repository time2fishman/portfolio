# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #1: Your Portfolio Site
For your first project, you'll be creating a portfolio site using HTML, CSS and
JS! 

This is an opportunity to **be creative**, and work through some **tough, real-world
programming challenges** as you build a frontend application from scratch.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you
along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

## Purpose 🧐

What do you want people to find when they google you?
What do you want someone's first impression of you to be?
Your portfolio is the portal to your professional online presence.
It consolidates the content you've created on multiple platforms and presents
it in digest form, making it easier for future employers to learn more about you.

## User Stories to Get Started 👩‍💻👨‍💻🧑‍💻
- As a non-technical HR manager, I want to quickly see the skills and experience of a candidate, so that I can evaluate whether the candidate meets the requirements for an open position at my company.
- As a mid-level engineer, I want view a junior developer's project and read their code, so that I can evaluate their coding skills.
- As a friend of the person who built this portfolio, I want to see what my friend has built so that I have an understanding of what they do as a developer and I can encourage them.

## Requirements 

### &#x1F534; Mandatory To Pass:

#### MVP - Minimum Viable Product

#### Your application must meet these requirements:

1. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
1. Hosted on Netlify or Github Pages.
1. Commits to Github every day.
1. A `README.md` file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

#### The app must:

1. Have the following pages:
	- home (greeting page)
	- bio (your background)
	- resume (past work experience)
	- projects (a place to hold interesting projects that you build -- we'll be adding to this as we build more applications in class)
	- links (links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and other sites you find interesting)
		- optionally, instead of making this a separate page, you can make these links appear as part of a navigation section that appears on all pages
1. Use JS to create at least three points of interaction for the user (e.g. the user clicks on something and something happens).  Write these from scratch.  Each point should be a different kind of interaction (i.e. don't just create 3 modals).  Don't use 3rd party frameworks/libraries like jQuery UI, Bootstrap, etc.
1. Implement responsive design (i.e. it should be fully functional on desktop, tablet, mobile, etc.).

### &#x1F535; Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory):

- Create a complex user interface module (e.g. a carousel, modal, sticky nav, etc)
- Create an additional browser-based game (e.g. a quiz, choose your own adventure, battle game, etc)
- Research AJAX (covered later in this course) and create an app that displays interesting data from an external source (ask your instructor for a list of good sources)

## Submit Your Proposal
Before starting to code, submit your proposal [here](../../issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=proposal.md) as an issue ticket on this repo

## Make A New Repo

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Make your new repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/)!
  - We recommend that you name your repo appropriately (for example `portfolio`, and _**not**_ something like `unit-one-project`).

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Do not** begin your project within this class repo.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Do not** clone your project into the class repo.

:heavy_exclamation_mark:  After your project proposal has been approved, [make a new github repo for your project](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/).

## Deploying your Project

For anyone to be able to see and use your project, you must deploy it online somewhere. For this project, you will be deploying it onto either Netlify or GitHub Pages


#### Try to use Netlify first...
  - Directions for deploying to Netlify can be found in this [markdown](./netlify.md)


#### If for some reason, Netlify is not working for you, deploy on GH Pages...
  - For directions on using GH Pages, follow the instructions outlined by Github themselves on [github.io](https://pages.github.com/)

  - Follow the instructions under: Project Site > Start from Scratch

<details><summary>Extra: want your own domain name?</summary>

You can also host your github pages with your own domain name. [Here is a walkthrough from namecheap, one web hosting service](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages)

</details>


### Think about...

- **Creativity**  
  Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

- **Code Quality**  
  Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indentation, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

- **Problem Solving**  
  Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?


## Deliverables Checklist

This is your project checklist.  Make sure to revisit it before you submit your project! Your submission must include **all** of the following:

- A portfolio, built by you, hosted on Netlify or Github Pages
- Individual files for HTML, CSS, and JS following the principle of separation of concerns
- Your HTML/CSS should pass the [HTML5 Validator](https://html5.validator.nu)
  and [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) without significant errors or warnings
- Your JavaScript should be cleanly formatted (use Prettier!) and not contain any console.logs (you can search for them with command + F [or ctrl + F on Windows/Ubuntu] and then remove them or comment them out).
- A git repository hosted on Github with frequent commits dating back to the
  very beginning of the project (**at least one commit is required per day of the project**).
- A `README.md` file that includes the following sections:
  - [ ] An embedded screenshot of the app
  - [ ] List of the **Technologies used**
  - [ ] **Installation instructions**
  - [ ] Your **User stories** – who are your users, what do they want
        and why?
  - [ ] Your **Wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in
        your application
  - [ ] Descriptions of any **Unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had
        to overcome
- A link to your hosted project in the URL section of your Github repo.

### Project Submission

**_DO NOT FORK THIS REPOSITORY!_** Create a **new** repository on your personal GitHub account. Then, submit your project as an issue to [the project 1 gallery repository](../../../project-1-gallery).

You must turn in something before presentations begin. However, you're welcome
to (and should!) continue working on it over the course of SEIR and beyond!

With your submission please include any questions you'd like answered, or
specific things on which you'd like us to focus when giving feedback.

Once you've submitted your project, make sure to visit your fellow cohort mates' projects.  Leave them some encouraging words or ask them about some code they wrote in the comments of their issue!

### Project Presentations

It is a common practice on development teams to have a demo day every two weeks at the end of each development cycle (known as a sprint or iteration). On demo day, teams meet to share what they've accomplished during the current sprint.  

To prepare you for this, for project 1, you will give a demo of your project to your squad.  Each person will be given approximately 5-10 minutes to demonstrate their project, talk about some part of their code that they are particularly proud of, share their experiences working on the project, and answer questions from squad members.  

You must present your project at this time, even if you did not complete the requirements.  If you do not show up for project presentations, your project will not be deemed as submitted and you will not be eligible for graduation.  

During presentations, there should be **no working on your code** while others are presenting. This is your
chance to ask others how they tackled their project.

Be prepared to answer questions like:

- What would you do differently?
- What are you most proud of?
- What would you do next?
- How did you plan your project?
- What did you learn?


## Project Week Format

- No daily attendance on Zoom required **except for morning exercises & Outcomes **. If you’re absent for morning exercises or Outcomes that will count as a full day absence, so please show up!
- You **are** required to be responsive on Slack to attendance threads and any instructor messages. 
- You are required to communicate with your squad lead **daily**!  This may be in the form of a [daily stand up](https://geekbot.com/blog/daily-standup-meeting/?k_id=dsa-910872033553&adgroup_id=96910465570&campaign_name_ad=10071775578&gclid=CjwKCAjwzvX7BRAeEiwAsXExo25ZchZ9JOgDt-esFT0qW6Dj36sgBtYkCHLhf-NPH4W7Cw1rKiWhkxoCXVUQAvD_BwE) or Slack check in.  Your squad lead will provide more details.
- Projects must be submitted to the [gallery (via an issue)](../../../project-1-gallery/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=project-submission.md&title=YOUR+FULL+NAME) by the date on your course schedule.
- Project presentations will be begin at the time indicated on your course schedule.  You must present your project at this time.  If you do not show up for project presentations, your project will not be deemed as submitted and you will not be eligible for graduation.
- Office hours can be found in the course schedule.

## Recommendations for Success

- Make a schedule for yourself of what you want to accomplish
  - First day most details
  - Second day less details broader strokes of what you want to accomplish
  - Further: try to pick 'milestones' (check with the project markdown that you are building what you need for MVP) and determine the order of importance, be sure to have a separate list for stretch goals
  - This takes practice so be ready to adjust your schedule

    - **Note: You will have to make changes and adjust/adapt as you build**

- Create a bronze, silver, and gold plan.  This is your first project and you don't have a good way to estimate how long individual tasks will take, so it's better to set the bar low.  There's no problem with under-promising and over-delivering!  You can always add more features if time allows. However, if you focus on non-MVP features before your MVP is complete and run out of time, your submission will not satisfy the project requirements.
- **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation,
  views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.
  Use a whiteboard or notebook to capture your thoughts!
- **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc)
  to debug and solve problems
- **Don't under estimate the value of planning!** Use tools like [Trello](https://trello.com/en-US) or [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/features/project-management/) and track your progress against milestones.  Don't think of the working game as the goal.  Think of the next milestone as the goal (e.g., getting my click handler to work, or getting the UI implemented).  This will feel far less overwhelming and each successfully completed milestone will provide you with the motivation to tackle the next task!
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you
  can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Make it work, make it good, make it fast.** Don't get hung up on only saving
  or writing code that is good code. Get it working first, even if it means
  writing bad or ugly code. Once it's working, come back and refactor!
- **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, etc.) to better
  understand what you’ll be getting into.
- **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.**
  Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real
  data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to
  change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose
  game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

## Where to go for help during project week

1. Seek out help online.
1. Seek out help with your classmates. Make sure you post in the debugging channel so the instructors can keep track of who is asking for help!
1. Seek out help with our class IA/TAs.
1. After all other avenues have been exhausted, seek help from your assigned instructor. See Office Hours below. 

### Github Issues

We strongly encourage you to file a [Github issue in this repository](../../issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md&title=YOUR+NAME+-+BUG+DESCRIPTION) prior to asking the instructors for help directly. 

Having to articulate the question into words is very helpful in understanding the problem. Sometimes, simply articulating the question gives you the answer. 

More importantly, submitting issues, creating bug reports, and posting questions about code on platforms like stackoverflow.com is something you will do ***regularly*** when you're employed in the industry.  Learning how to communicate about your code errors and issues is an essential skill that takes practice to get good at doing effectively and succinctly, and will make it easier for your instructors to help you.

### Office Hours Appointments

Instructors will be hosting office hours at the times marked on the course schedule
each day of project week. The regular TA office hours will also be available.
Check the course schedule for more information.

> The purpose of this project is for you to show us and future employers what
> you're capable of, so we want as much of the project to be your own,
> independent work as possible.

## Plagiarism

Take a moment to re-familiarize yourself with the [plagiarism policy](../../../course-intro/blob/master/plagiarism.md).  

Projects give you an opportunity to apply the skills you're learning in a practical manner.  If you're struggling with something, that's okay!  In fact, that's why you're here -- if this was easy and you could do it already, you wouldn't be here. These assignments are similar to those you can expect when applying for a job,
either in the form of a take-home coding challenge or an in-person technical
interview. So lean in, get comfortable with being uncomfortable, and challenge
yourself to complete this project on your own.
